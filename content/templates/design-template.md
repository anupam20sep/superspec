# Design: {{FEATURE}}

**Revision**: [DATE] | **Status**: [DRAFT|APPROVED] | **Owner**: [NAME]

**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/{{FEATURE}}/spec.md`

**Note**: This unified design document merges Spec Kit's separate plan/research/data-model/contracts artifacts into one tier per SuperSpec's 4-layer architecture.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach + key decisions]

**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Architecture

### System Structure

[Describe the high-level system architecture: major components, their responsibilities, and how they interact. Reference the selected project structure below.]

<!--
  NOTE: Governance gates (mandatory TDD, traceability completeness, etc.) are defined
  in the separate constitution.md tier document and enforced by the superspec-validate
  stage, not inline here. This design.md focuses purely on architecture, decisions,
  data model, and contracts.

#### Source Code (repository root)

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the placeholder tree below with the concrete layout
  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered design must
  not include Option labels.

**Structure Decision**: [Document the selected structure and reference the real directories captured above. Explain trade-offs if multiple options were evaluated.]

## Decisions

Each significant design decision is documented in ADR format below. For decisions warranting dedicated files, cross-reference them in the `specs/{{FEATURE}}/adr/` directory.

### Decision: [Example: Use PostgreSQL for primary data store]

**Rationale**: 
[Explain why this decision was made. Include:
- Problem statement: what question needed answering?
- Context: constraints, requirements, trade-offs]
Example: PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance, supports complex relational schemas, and has strong community support. Our scale/scope (see Technical Context) requires transactional consistency.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Option A**: [e.g., NoSQL document store] — [reason rejected, e.g., schema flexibility not needed; operational overhead higher]
- **Option B**: [e.g., In-memory cache layer] — [reason rejected, e.g., durability requirement]

### Decision: [Add your decisions here]

**Rationale**: 
[Explain the decision and its context.]

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Option A**: [Reason rejected]
- **Option B**: [Reason rejected]

## Data Model

### Entities

[Describe the primary entities, their fields, relationships, and any invariants or constraints. Use a table, ER diagram reference, or structured text as appropriate.]

| Entity | Fields | Primary Key | Relationships | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| [Entity name] | [e.g., id, name, created_at] | [PK] | [e.g., has_many: items; belongs_to: user] | [domain notes] |

Or, for simpler schemas, describe inline:

**[Entity Name]**
- `id` (UUID): Primary key
- `name` (string): Entity name, max 255 chars
- `created_at` (timestamp): Creation time
- `status` (enum: ACTIVE, ARCHIVED): Current status
- Relationships: [describe associations to other entities]
- Invariants: [e.g., name must be non-empty; status transitions follow state machine]

{{ENTITIES}}

## Contracts

### API / Service Interfaces

[Describe the external APIs, event schemas, function signatures, or data interchange formats this feature exposes or consumes. Include versioning strategy if applicable.]

#### Example: REST Endpoint

```
POST /api/v1/{{FEATURE}}
Content-Type: application/json

Request:
{
  "name": "Example Name",
  "description": "Feature description",
  "metadata": {...}
}

Response (201 Created):
{
  "id": "uuid-here",
  "name": "Example Name",
  "description": "Feature description",
  "metadata": {...},
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}

Error Response (400 Bad Request):
{
  "error": "INVALID_INPUT",
  "message": "Field 'name' is required",
  "details": {...}
}
```

#### Example: Function Signature (Library)

```python
def create_{{feature}}(
    name: str,
    description: str,
    metadata: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
    **options
) -> {{Feature}}:
    """
    Create a new {{feature}} instance.
    
    Args:
        name: The name of the {{feature}} (required, max 255 chars).
        description: Human-readable description.
        metadata: Optional key-value pairs for extensibility.
        **options: Additional configuration (see docs).
    
    Returns:
        A {{Feature}} object with id, timestamps, and status.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If required fields are missing or invalid.
        RuntimeError: If creation fails (e.g., database error).
    """
```

#### Integration Points

[List external systems, APIs, or services this feature integrates with. Include protocol, auth method, rate limits, SLAs.]

- **[Service Name]**: [Protocol, e.g., REST/gRPC], [Auth, e.g., OAuth2], [Rate limit], [SLA]
- [Add more as needed]

### Event Schema (if applicable)

[If this feature publishes or consumes events, define the schema: topic/channel, payload structure, retention, ordering guarantees.]

```json
{
  "event_type": "{{FEATURE}}.created",
  "version": "1.0",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid-here",
    "name": "Example Name",
    "metadata": {...}
  }
}
```
