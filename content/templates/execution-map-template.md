# Execution Map: {{FEATURE}}

An execution map coordinates parallel task windows, model routing decisions, persona assignments, and verification gates for feature delivery. It bridges feature specs with task-level orchestration by making parallelizable work explicit and ensuring quality gates are applied per window.

## Dependency DAG

Tasks in this feature form the following dependency graph:

| From | To | Reason |
|------|----|---------:|
| T001: Backend schema migration | T002: Seed test data | T002 requires the new schema in place |
| T002: Seed test data | T003: Service layer tests | Tests need fixtures |
| T001: Backend schema migration | T004: API endpoints | Endpoints depend on schema |
| T004: API endpoints | T005: Integration tests | Must test the live endpoints |

**Graphical representation:**
```
T001 (schema)
  ├─→ T002 (seed data)
  │     └─→ T003 (service tests)
  └─→ T004 (API)
        └─→ T005 (integration tests)
```

Tasks T001 and T006 (frontend component) are independent and may start immediately. Task T002 and T004 may run in parallel after T001 completes.

## Parallel Windows

Windows define groups of tasks that can execute concurrently. No two tasks in a window may share write access to the same file or depend on sequential output from each other.

| Window | Tasks | Model Routing | Parallelization Boundary |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| **W1: Schema & Structure** | T001 (schema migration) | `heavy` → strong | Schema migration sets the stage; cannot parallelize with dependent tasks. |
| **W2: Data Layer** | T002 (seed data), T006 (frontend setup) | `mechanical` → fast | Data seeding and frontend setup have no shared writes and no dependencies. ⚠️ Do NOT parallelize T002 with T003 (service tests); T003 needs T002's fixtures first. |
| **W3: API & Frontend** | T004 (API endpoints), T007 (frontend components) | `heavy` → strong | API and frontend development are independent until integration. |
| **W4: Testing & Integration** | T003 (service layer tests), T005 (integration tests) | `mechanical` → fast | Unit-level service tests and full integration tests can run together after data/API layers are ready. |
| **W5: Quality Gates** | All verification checks (coverage, lint, type safety) | `mechanical` → fast | Run after all development windows complete. |

**Parallelization Constraints:**
- ⚠️ T002 (seed data) must complete before T003 starts—they share the test database state.
- ⚠️ T004 (API endpoints) must complete before T005 starts—integration tests call the live API.
- ⚠️ Window W5 must not start until W1 through W4 are complete.

## Model Routing

Task complexity determines which model handles the work:

| Task | Complexity | Model Class | Rationale |
|------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| T001: Schema migration | `heavy` | `strong` | Complex data model changes; requires reasoning about backward compatibility and performance. |
| T002: Seed test data | `mechanical` | `fast` | Deterministic; follows a script. No ambiguity about intent. |
| T003: Service layer tests | `mechanical` | `fast` | Straightforward test writing given a clear service interface. |
| T004: API endpoint implementation | `heavy` | `strong` | Requires design decisions (routing, error handling, middleware order, rate limiting strategy). |
| T005: Integration tests | `mechanical` | `fast` | Once API is defined, tests are deterministic. |
| T006: Frontend setup | `mechanical` | `fast` | Scaffolding and boilerplate setup. |
| T007: Frontend components | `heavy` | `strong` | Component design, state management, accessibility requirements. |

**Model Class Mapping:** `routeModel(complexity) → { "heavy" → "strong", "mechanical" → "fast" }`

## Personas

Each task or window is owned by a persona responsible for execution, code review, and sign-off:

| Window | Primary Persona | Secondary Persona | Responsibilities |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| W1: Schema & Structure | **@backend** (Database) | @tech-lead | Schema review, migration safety, test data contracts. |
| W2: Data Layer | @backend (Data) | — | Seed scripts, test fixture maintenance. |
| W3: API & Frontend | @backend (API); @frontend | — | Parallel development, contract definition (OpenAPI or GraphQL schema). |
| W4: Testing & Integration | @qa; @backend; @frontend | @tech-lead | Test coverage, edge cases, cross-team integration. |
| W5: Quality Gates | @tech-lead | @security; @performance | Lint, types, coverage, security scan, load-test results. |

**Persona Definitions:**
- `@backend`: Owns database, migrations, service layer, API contract.
- `@frontend`: Owns client UI, state, build pipeline.
- `@qa`: Owns test strategy, coverage targets, integration scenarios.
- `@tech-lead`: Owns architecture decisions, cross-cutting concerns, gate approvals.
- `@security`: Reviews auth, encryption, input validation, RBAC.
- `@performance`: Reviews query plans, caching, asset optimization.

## Rollback

Each window has a rollback plan:

| Window | Rollback Strategy |
|--------|-------------------|
| W1: Schema & Structure | Revert commit range `C1..C3` (schema commits). Schema must be rolled back before seeding. If in production, use database downtime window + manual intervention to drop migration and restore backup. |
| W2: Data Layer | Delete seeded test records via rollback script `scripts/rollback-fixtures.sh`. If production seed only: use targeted `DELETE` statements scoped to test markers (e.g., `WHERE is_test_data = true`). |
| W3: API & Frontend | Revert commit range `C4..C7` (API + frontend). No database impact; safe to revert. Feature flag can disable new endpoints while code is reverted. |
| W4: Testing & Integration | Revert test files and update CI config if tests are in the main branch. No production impact. |
| W5: Quality Gates | Fix lint/type issues in place; no rollback needed. If coverage drops below threshold, flag in code review—do not merge. |

**General Rollback Process:**
1. Identify the window that must roll back.
2. Gather commits for that window (use `git log --oneline W1..W5`).
3. Create a revert commit: `git revert -n C1^..C7 && git commit -m "revert: {{FEATURE}} — [REASON]"`.
4. Test the revert in a staging environment.
5. Deploy revert with the same rigor as the original feature.

## Verification Gates

Before a window is considered "done," the following checks must pass:

| Gate | Applies To | Criteria | Owner |
|------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Schema Validation** | W1 | Schema change passes `npm run db:validate`. No breaking changes to existing API contracts. Tested on backup data. | @backend |
| **Unit Test Coverage** | W2, W3, W4 | All new code has ≥80% line coverage (≥90% for critical paths like auth, payments). Coverage diffs tracked in CI. | @qa, @backend |
| **Type Safety** | W3, W5 | `npm run typecheck` passes. No `any` types except in explicitly-allowed legacy modules. | @tech-lead |
| **Linting** | W5 | `npm run lint -- --fix` applies no changes. ESLint and Prettier agree. | @tech-lead |
| **Contract Tests** | W3 (API), W4 | API schema validated against OpenAPI spec. Frontend mock server matches live API. Cross-team contract signed off. | @backend, @frontend |
| **Integration Tests** | W4 | All integration tests pass on the staging environment. No flaky tests; 3 consecutive green runs required. | @qa |
| **Security Scan** | W5 | SAST scan (e.g., `npm audit`, Snyk) returns 0 high/critical vulns. Secrets not committed (pre-commit hook enforces). | @security |
| **Performance Baseline** | W5 | For W3 (API): new endpoints have ≤200ms p99 latency under load test (100 req/s). For W3 (frontend): Lighthouse score ≥90. | @performance |
| **Rollback Rehearsal** | W5 | Rollback procedure tested in staging. Revert commits cleanly; no orphaned references or state. | @tech-lead |

**Gate Policy:**
- Gates are checked per window; a gate failure blocks that window's merge.
- If a gate fails, the owning persona files a bug or adds a task to resolve it before re-review.
- Code review approval by the primary persona is required before a window is merged.
